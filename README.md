# sudoku-solver

This is a web/javascript based sudoku solver that aims to solve any sudoku puzzle it is given. It does not give tips to the user, nor does it solve the puzzle in the same way a human would. Instead it makes a series of 50/50 guesses and finds the guess that doesn't lead to an invalid board.

It has been tested and successfully solved some of the most difficult sudoku puzzles that exist.
